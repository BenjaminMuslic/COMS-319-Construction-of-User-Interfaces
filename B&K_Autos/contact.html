            <h2>About</h2>

            <h4>B&K Autos was founded in March 12th, 2023, by visionary entrepreneurs, Benjamin Muslic and Kareem Eljaam. 
                This website was created as a midterm project for the course SE/ComS319.</h4>
                <br>
                <h3>Two colleagues with an idea</h3>
                <h4>Both Muslic and Eljaam are working towards getting their degrees in Computer Engineering from Iowa State University, 
                where they honed their technical expertise. After working for leading tech companies, 
                they were inspired to pursue their passion for automobiles and establish their own business.
                Drawing on their childhood love for cars, they leveraged their technical know-how to create a cutting-edge website and 
                streamlined operations for their dealership. Driven by a commitment to excellence, Muslic and Eljaam are dedicated to providing their 
                valued customers with unparalleled service and support for all of their driving needs.</h4>
